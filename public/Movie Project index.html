<h1>Manny's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Belly</h3>
<p>One of the best hood classics. Cast includes most of my favorite rappers.</p>
<h3>Clockwork Orange</h3>
<p>My favorite Stanley Kubrik film. Captivating story based on a great book.</p>
<h3>The 36th Chamber of Shaolin</h3>
<p>Probably my favorite kung fu movie of all time. It is also the inspiration behind one of my favorite rap albums.</p>
